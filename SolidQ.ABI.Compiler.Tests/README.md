# ABI Unit Tests
Adaptive BI Framework Compiler and Plugins Unit Tests

## Before you begin
The `ColumnsMetadataCompiler` test needs to connect to a default SQL Server Instance located at `localhost`. It also needs to have a SQL Server Alias named `test\named`.

To add an alias you can follow the instructions here: [How to setup and use a SQL Server alias](How%20to%20setup%20and%20use%20a%20SQL%20Server%20alias)
